# ROS Baxter 
[Baxter Report](ROS_Baxter_Report.pdf)

This was a group project that utilized Baxter to first see a number and then
move accordingly the number of blocks that it saw from one location to another.

This project used ROS to work with Baxter and utlized hte motors and cameras on
Baxter in order to complete our task. We split up the project into three parts

1. Feeding an image to Baxter
2. Digit Classification
3. Movement of Blocks

For digit classification we used CNN and trained on MNIST. 
Then we moved the blocks by programming the grippers on Baxter to move
each block from one table to another.
